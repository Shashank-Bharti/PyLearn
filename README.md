## Python Learning Repository

This repository contains my personalized Python learning files, structured around chapters, practice sheets, and advanced projects inspired by the "Python in 10 Hours" video by CodeWithHarry.  
While I followed the video, I also added my own knowledge to tailor the content.

## Contents

- **Chapters 1-11**: Each chapter has its own folder with practice sheets containing Q&A.  
- **Advanced Python**: Two folders dedicated to advanced Python concepts, each with its own practice sheets.  
- **Mega Projects**: Two standalone projects that apply the concepts learned.  

## Reference

This learning was inspired by [CodeWithHarry's Python in 10 Hours](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrsmFxEIp5k&t=17116s) YouTube video.
